### Work in progress

_The effect of legislative misalignment on representation of constituency interests_  
&nbsp; with Vardges Levonyan

 <font size="1"> We study how the correction of imperfect information in the legislature affects the representation of constituency interests. While belief updating ideally is expected to result in re-optimization by market actors, the effect on elite behaviour is less clear. This is because MPs pay a reputation cost when altering their policy stands, which could result in them abstaining from re-aligning with their districts when they receive new information about their constituencies’ preferences. Using a difference-in-differences setup and the Brexit referendum as a natural experiment that educates MPs about their constituencies’ leaning, we find that MPs who unexpectedly learn that they are misaligned with their districts (receive a negative information shock) avoid issues on which they are misaligned, relative to aligned MPs. Instead, they use more populist rhetoric, and push party ideology to obtain re-alignment. Our results show how legislators use populism and polarization as tools to avoid drawing attention to issues where there is a mismatch between voters and the legislature. </font>

<font size="1"> How does strong party discipline affect MPs’ willingness to represent local interests
during times of distress? This paper uses parliamentary speeches from Norway
together with unique data on parliamentary attendance and politicians’ travels to
study how local economic hardship, proxied by unemployment, shapes legislators’
representational efforts in the national parliament. Contrary to what one would
expect, I find that MPs deliver significantly fewer speeches and speak less about
unemployment during local economic downturns. Using word embeddings together
with recently developed methods to identify choices in high-dimensional data, I
show that when MPs do speak about unemployment during times of distress, they
deviate less from the party line. Deviations are favored by local voters but penalized
financially by the party. These results demonstrate how it can be rational for
party elites in well-functioning democracies to restrict MPs from representing subnational
interests because they want to prevent deviations from the party line from
compromising the party brand. </font>
