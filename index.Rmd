  Welcome to my website!
  
  
2024-2025, I will be at  [$\color{darkdarkblue}{\text{LSE for a research stay}}$][LSE]. I am a postdoc (Bruno Latour Fellow) at Sciences Po's Department of Economics, where I study elite behavior and climate change politics. I also teach students about the political economy of climate change. 
  
  I obtained my PhD in Economics from BI Norwegian Business School. In my dissertation, I used Natural Language Processing to study the behavior of political elites, with a focus on how political parties are functioning as intermediaries between voters and politicians. At its core, my research concerns how political institutions shape the behavior of politicians and touches on the underlying drivers of elite polarization and (mis)representation. Two years of my PhD were spent at Harvard University as a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Government.
