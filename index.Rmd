  Welcome to my website!
  
  
  I am a final-year PhD Candidate in Economics at BI Norwegian Business School. In my dissertation, I am using Natural Language Processing to study the behaviour of political elites, with a focus on how political parties are functioning as a political intermediaries between voters and politicians. At its cote, my research touches on the underlying drivers and consequences of political polarization, populism, and (mis)representation.  
  
  Since August 2021, I have been affiliated with Harvard University as a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Government.  
  
  I have a Master's degree in Comparative Economics and Policy from University College London. My undergraduate studies cover economics, finance, business, and area and language studies.
