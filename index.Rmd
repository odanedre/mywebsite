I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Economics at [$\color{darkdarkblue}{\text{King's College London}}$][KCL]'s Department of Political Economy. My research examines the behavior of political elites, with a particular focus on elite strategies and patterns of representation. Much of my work uses text-as-data to investigate how political institutions shape politicians’ behavior and explores the underlying drivers of elite polarization and (mis)representation.

Before joining KCL I was a postdoc (Bruno Latour Fellow) at Sciences Po's Department of Economics. I obtained my PhD in Economics from BI Norwegian Business School. Two years of my PhD were spent at Harvard University as a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Government.
