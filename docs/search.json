I am a postdoc (Bruno Latour Fellow) at Sciences Po’s Department of Economics, where I study elite behavior and climate change politics. I also teach students about the political economy of climate change.\nI obtained my PhD in Economics from BI Norwegian Business School. In my dissertation, I used Natural Language Processing to study the behavior of political elites, with a focus on how political parties are functioning as intermediaries between voters and politicians. At its core, my research concerns how political institutions shape the behavior of politicians and touches on the underlying drivers of elite polarization and (mis)representation. Two years of my PhD were spent at Harvard University as a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Government.\nYou can find my CV \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\), my Google Scholar profile \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\), and read more about my research \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\)\nFeel free to contact me at oda.nedregard@sciencespo.fr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

ISO 690\nWorking papers\nStaying in Line or Straying for Votes: Party Discipline and Dyadic Representation (2025)\n How does strong party discipline shape legislators’ responsiveness to local concerns? In list-based proportional representation systems, parties’ control of ballot rankings creates strong incentives to align with party elites, which is postulated to distort the constituency-representative link. I develop a theory of cohesion under PR and test it in Norway – a uniquely beneficial setting to study party discipline. Leveraging seat security to capture within-party, within-district variations in incentives to align with districts, I show that legislators who are more dependent on local voters to secure reelection deviate more from the party line during local distress, compared to safe MPs. Deviations are rewarded by constituents but penalized by voters in other districts, demonstrating how deviations can benefit the legislator but be costly to the party. This refines our understanding of cohesion under PR by showing how electoral incentives shape legislative behavior not only across electoral systems but also within them. \nThe effect of legislative misalignment on the representation of constituency interests (2025)\n  with Vardges Levonyan\n How do elected representatives respond when they learn that they are misaligned with their constituencies? While existing research has documented various mechanisms promoting alignment between public opinion and legislative behavior, including electoral turnover, candidate self-selection, and elite influence on public opinion, less is known about how politicians handle misalignment. Previous studies suggest two primary responses: updating positions to match constituent preferences or discounting opposing views. We propose and investigate a third response: strategic issue avoidance. Using the 2016 Brexit referendum as an information treatment that creates within-issue, within-election period, within-MP variation in alignment, we study how MPs responded to sudden, measurable incongruence with their constituencies. We find that MPs who learn that they are misaligned with their districts avoid issues on which they are misaligned, relative to their aligned counterparts. When speaking about the misaligned issue, they avoid stance-taking on the issue. They also avoid mentioning their constituency. Our results show how misaligned MPs abstain from controversial issues to avoid drawing attention to topics where there is a mismatch between the legislature and the constituency. \nThe female vote and PR adoption (2025)\n  with Mona Morgan-Collins\n Did women’s suffrage play any role in the adoption of proportional systems (PR)?\nExtant literature uncovers three broad explanations for the spread of PR across Western\nEurope at the turn of the 20th century. These explanations emphasize the rise of\nelectoral, economic and party threats generated by the expansion of men’s suffrage.\nInterestingly, neither account considers the role of women’s suffrage. This ‘analytical’\ninvisibility of women’s suffrage is striking, especially given that countries that adopted\nboth PR and women’s suffrage at the turn of the 20th century almost invariably adopted\nPR at the same time or shortly after women’s suffrage.\nIn this paper, we suggest that this sequencing of electoral reforms was not coincidental\nand develop a novel explanation of PR adoption that highlights an electoral threat\nposed by women’s suffrage. Women’s votes were both distinct as well as more volatile\nthan men’s. This required that politicians adapted their campaign appeals and built\nsolid support base among women. We argue that support of PR was a direct response\nto the influx of new voters. Framing PR as a group-based appeal to women, politicians\ncould both better capture and stabilize women’s votes, mitigating the threats posed by\nwomen’s suffrage.\nUsing the case of Norway, we conduct extensive archival work to demonstrate that politicians frequently justified\nPR reform with references to women’s representation and that women’s groups invariably\nlobbied for the reform. Using district-level electoral and roll-call data, we then\nshow that politicians were more likely to vote for PR in districts when women constituted\nlarger share of voters. Including a large battery of controls, we account for\nall existing explanation and show that the weight of women’s votes is the strongest\npredictor of PR than any other extant explanations.\nBeyond uncovering a novel explanation of PR adoption at the turn of the 20th century,\nthis paper has profound implications for the role of women’s suffrage on women’s\nrepresentation. Our results suggest that women’s suffrage alone may not improve\nwomen’s descriptive and substantive representation if it is not accompanied with an\notherwise inclusive electoral institution. \nWork in progress\nGendered Voices in Climate Politics: Evidence from the UK Parliament\n  with Heloïse Clolery\nMore Catholic than the Pope?
