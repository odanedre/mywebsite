In my dissertation, I am using Natural Language Processing to study the behaviour of political elites, with a focus on how political parties are functioning as a political intermediaries between voters and politicians. At its cote, my research touches on the underlying drivers and consequences of political polarization, populism, and (mis)representation.\nSince August 2021, I have been affiliated with Harvard University as a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Government.\nI have a Master’s degree in Comparative Economics and Policy from University College London. My undergraduate studies cover economics, finance, business, and area and language studies.\nYou can find my CV here, read more about my research here, and my Google Scholar profile here\nSupervisors: Prof. Jon Fiva and Prof. Benny Geys.\nTwitter\nFeel free to contact me at oda.nedregard@bi.no\n\n\n\n\n",

This paper uses parliamentary speeches from Norway\ntogether with unique data on parliamentary attendance and politicians’ travels to\nstudy how local economic hardship, proxied by unemployment, shapes legislators’\nrepresentational efforts in national parliament. Contrary to what one would expect,\nI find that MPs deliver significantly fewer speeches and talk less about unemployment\nduring economic downturns. Using word embeddings together with recently\ndeveloped methods to identify choices in high-dimensional data, I show that, conditional\non speaking, MPs tend to deviate more in floor speeches when their districts\nare in distress. Such deviations are favored by local voters but penalized financially\nby the party. These results demonstrate how it can be rational for party elites in\nwell-functioning democracies to restrict MPs from representing local interests because\nthey want to prevent deviations from the party line from compromising the\nparty brand. \nThe effect of legislative misalignment of representation of constituency interests\n  with Vardges Levonyan\n We study how the correction of imperfect information in the legislature affects the representation of constituency interests. While belief updating ideally is expected to result in re-optimization by market actors, the effect on elite behaviour is less clear. This is because MPs pay a reputation cost when altering their policy stands, which could result in them abstaining from re-aligning with their districts when they receive new information about their constituencies’ preferences. Using a difference-in-differences setup and the Brexit referendum as a natural experiment that educates MPs about their constituencies’ leaning, we find that MPs who unexpectedly learn that they are misaligned with their districts (receive a negative information shock) avoid issues on which they are misaligned, relative to aligned MPs. Instead, they use more populist rhetoric, and push party ideology to obtain re-alignment. Our results show how legislators use populism and polarization as tools to avoid drawing attention to issues where there is a mismatch between voters and the legislature. \nThe causal effect of trust in government on green policymaking\n  single-authored\nLegislative party groups and party cohesion (book chapter)\n  with Martin Søyland\nWorking papers\nGroup Identities and Parliamentary Debates (2023)\n  with Jon Fiva and Henning Øien, RR, Journal of Politics\nPublications\nHow Does Party Discipline Affect Legislative Behavior?
