In my dissertation, I am using Natural Language Processing to study the behaviour of political elites, with a focus on how political parties are functioning as intermediaries between voters and politicians. At its core, my research touches on the underlying drivers and consequences of political polarization, populism, and (mis)representation.\nSince August 2021, I have been affiliated with Harvard University as a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Government.\nI have a Master’s degree in Comparative Economics and Policy from University College London. My undergraduate studies cover economics, finance, business, and area and language studies.\nYou can find my CV \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\), my Google Scholar profile \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\), and read more about my research \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\)\nSupervisors: Prof. Jon Fiva and Prof. Benny Geys.\nFeel free to contact me at oda.nedregard@bi.no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

While belief updating ideally is expected to result in re-optimization by market actors, the effect on elite behaviour is less clear. This is because MPs pay a reputation cost when altering their policy stands, which could result in them abstaining from re-aligning with their districts when they receive new information about their constituencies’ preferences. Using a difference-in-differences setup and the Brexit referendum as a natural experiment that educates MPs about their constituencies’ leaning, we find that MPs who unexpectedly learn that they are misaligned with their districts (receive a negative information shock) avoid issues on which they are misaligned, relative to aligned MPs. Instead, they use more populist rhetoric, and push party ideology to obtain re-alignment. Our results show how legislators use populism and polarization as tools to avoid drawing attention to issues where there is a mismatch between voters and the legislature. \nThe causal effect of trust in government on green policymaking\n  single-authored\nLegislative party groups and party cohesion (book chapter)\n  with Martin Søyland\nNorwegian Legislative Debates 1945–2022\n  with Jon Fiva\nWorking papers\nSpeech is Silver, Silence is Gold: Trade-offs between local and collective representation (2023)\n  single-authored\nGroup Identities and Parliamentary Debates (2023)\n  with Jon Fiva and Henning Øien, RR, Journal of Politics\nPublications\nHow Does Party Discipline Affect Legislative Behavior?
