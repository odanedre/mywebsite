I am a postdoc (Bruno Latour Fellow) at Sciences Po’s Department of Economics, where I study elite behavior and climate change politics. I also teach students about the political economy of climate change.\nI obtained my PhD in Economics from BI Norwegian Business School. In my dissertation, I used Natural Language Processing to study the behaviour of political elites, with a focus on how political parties are functioning as intermediaries between voters and politicians. At its core, my research touches on the underlying drivers and consequences of political polarization, populism, and (mis)representation. Two years of my PhD were spent at Harvard University as a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Government.\nYou can find my CV \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\), my Google Scholar profile \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\), and read more about my research \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\)\nI am also working on providing an overview of useful resources for students and researchers interested in doing independent research using text-as-data (see \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\)). As of now, the list is mainly targeted to a Norwegian audience.\nFeel free to contact me at oda.nedregard@sciencespo.fr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

While belief updating ideally is expected to result in re-optimization by market actors, the effect on elite behaviour is less clear. This is because MPs pay a reputation cost when altering their policy stands, which could result in them abstaining from re-aligning with their districts when they receive new information about their constituencies’ preferences. Using a difference-in-differences setup and the Brexit referendum as a natural experiment that educates MPs about their constituencies’ leaning, we find that MPs who unexpectedly learn that they are misaligned with their districts (receive a negative information shock) avoid issues on which they are misaligned, relative to aligned MPs. Instead, they use more populist rhetoric, and push party ideology to obtain re-alignment. Our results show how legislators use populism and polarization as tools to avoid drawing attention to issues where there is a mismatch between voters and the legislature. \nThe causal effect of trust in government on green policymaking\nFueling politics: Political ideology, election dynamics, and oil search licenses\nWorking papers\nNorwegian Parliamentary Debates 1945–2021\n  with Jon Fiva an Henning Øien, Accepted, Nature Scientific Data\n Data set with all Norwegian Parliamentary speeches in the period 1945 – 2021. We also include metadata on legislators’ committee membership, speaker status (minister, elected, deputy…), and descriptive characteristics. \nStaying in Line or Straying for Votes: Party Discipline and Dyadic Representation (2024)\n How does strong party discipline affect legislators’ responsiveness to local concerns? In list-based proportional representation systems, the election of candidates depends largely on their position on the ballot. This gives parties strong tools to discipline their elected officials, which can distort the link between the constituency and the representative. I test this hypothesis by studying speech allocation between legislators with heterogeneous incentives to deviate from the party line during local economic downturns in the party-centered environment of Norway. I find that only representatives with comparatively strong incentives to align with party elites at the expense of local voters speak more about unemployment when their ditricts are experiencing during local economic downturns. Deviations from the party line are rewarded by local voters but penalized by the party, which tightens floor access for deviating MPs. This demonstrates how strong parties in PR can obstruct the constituency-representative link in the pursuit of maintaining a coherent party brand. \nChilling in the Shade: Climate change resilience and climate change beliefs (2024)\n A large literature shows that risk perceptions are important to understand individuals’ attitude formation. How does resilience to climate change affect citizens’\nclimate attitudes? I show that the societal ability to address the negative consequences of\nclimate change, and not vulnerability to climate change, is important to understand\nclimate change perceptions. Across 28 European economies, citizens with a high\ndegree of climate change resilience are less likely to see humans as the main driver of\nclimate change and are less likely to call for strengthened public and private action\nto mitigate emissions. These findings are important to understand the lack of climate\nambition by shedding light on how strengthened resilience can compensate for\nvulnerability but at the risk of compromising future support for green policymaking. \nGroup Identities and Parliamentary Debates (2023)\n  with Jon Fiva and Henning Øien, RR, Journal of Politics\nPublications\nLegislative party groups and party cohesion, book chapter (2024)\n  with Martin Søyland, Oxford Handbook of Norwegian Politics\nHow Does Party Discipline Affect Legislative Behavior?
