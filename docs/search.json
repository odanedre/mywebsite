I also teach students about the political economy of climate change.\nI obtained my PhD in Economics from BI Norwegian Business School. In my dissertation, I used Natural Language Processing to study the behaviour of political elites, with a focus on how political parties are functioning as intermediaries between voters and politicians. At its core, my research touches on the underlying drivers and consequences of political polarization, populism, and (mis)representation. Two years of my PhD were spent at Harvard University as a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Government.\nYou can find my CV \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\), my Google Scholar profile \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\), and read more about my research \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\)\nI am also working on providing an overview of useful resources for students and researchers interested in doing independent research using text-as-data (see \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\)). As of now, the list is mainly targeted to a Norwegian audience.\nFeel free to contact me at oda.nedregard@sciencespo.fr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

While belief updating ideally is expected to result in re-optimization by market actors, the effect on elite behaviour is less clear. This is because MPs pay a reputation cost when altering their policy stands, which could result in them abstaining from re-aligning with their districts when they receive new information about their constituencies’ preferences. Using a difference-in-differences setup and the Brexit referendum as a natural experiment that educates MPs about their constituencies’ leaning, we find that MPs who unexpectedly learn that they are misaligned with their districts (receive a negative information shock) avoid issues on which they are misaligned, relative to aligned MPs. Instead, they use more populist rhetoric, and push party ideology to obtain re-alignment. Our results show how legislators use populism and polarization as tools to avoid drawing attention to issues where there is a mismatch between voters and the legislature. \nThe causal effect of trust in government on green policymaking\nFueling politics: Political ideology, election dynamics, and oil search licenses\nLegislative party groups and party cohesion (book chapter)\n  with Martin Søyland\nNorwegian Parliamentary Debates 1945–2021\n  with Jon Fiva an Henning Øien\n COMING SOON: Data set with all Norwegian Parliamentary speeches in the period 1945 – 2021. We also include metadata on legislators’ committee membership, speaker status (minister, elected, deputy…), and descriptive characteristics. \nWorking papers\nStaying in Line or Straying for Votes: Party Discipline and Dyadic Representation (2024)\n How does strong party discipline affect legislators’ responsiveness to local concerns? In list-based proportional representation systems, the election of candidates depends largely on their position on the ballot. This gives parties strong tools to discipline their elected officials, which can distort the link between the constituency and the representative. I test this hypothesis by studying speech allocation between legislators with heterogeneous incentives to deviate from the party line during local economic downturns in the party-centered environment of Norway. I find that only representatives with comparatively weak incentives to deviate from the party line are allowed to represent their districts during local economic downturns. Deviations are rewarded by local voters but penalized financially by the party, which reduces transfers to deviating MPs’ party organizations. This demonstrates how it can be rational for party elites to restrict MPs from representing subnational interests because they want to prevent deviations from the party line from compromising the party brand.\nGroup Identities and Parliamentary Debates (2023)\n  with Jon Fiva and Henning Øien, RR, Journal of Politics\nPublications\nHow Does Party Discipline Affect Legislative Behavior?
