I am a postdoc (Bruno Latour Fellow) at Sciences Po’s Department of Economics, where I study elite behavior and climate change politics. I also teach students about the political economy of climate change.\nI obtained my PhD in Economics from BI Norwegian Business School. In my dissertation, I used Natural Language Processing to study the behavior of political elites, with a focus on how political parties are functioning as intermediaries between voters and politicians. At its core, my research concerns how political institutions shape political behavior and touches on the underlying drivers and consequences of political polarization and (mis)representation. Two years of my PhD were spent at Harvard University as a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Government.\nYou can find my CV \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\), my Google Scholar profile \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\), and read more about my research \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\)\nI am also working on providing an overview of useful resources for students and researchers interested in doing independent research using text-as-data (see \\(\\color{darkdarkblue}{\\text{here}}\\)). As of now, the list is mainly targeted to a Norwegian audience.\nFeel free to contact me at oda.nedregard@sciencespo.fr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

ISO 690\nWorking papers\nStaying in Line or Straying for Votes: Party Discipline and Dyadic Representation (2025)\n How does strong party discipline shape legislators’ responsiveness to local concerns? In list-based proportional representation systems, parties’ control of ballot rankings creates strong incentives to align with party elites, which is postulated to distort the constituency-representative link. I develop a theory of cohesion under PR and test it in Norway – a uniquely beneficial setting to study party discipline. Leveraging seat security to capture within-party, within-district variations in incentives to align with districts, I show that legislators who are more dependent on local voters to secure reelection deviate more from the party line during local distress, compared to safe MPs. Deviations are rewarded by constituents but penalized by voters in other districts, demonstrating how deviations can benefit the legislator but be costly to the party. This refines our understanding of cohesion under PR by showing how electoral incentives shape legislative behavior not only across electoral systems but also within them. \nThe effect of legislative misalignment on the representation of constituency interests (2025)\n  with Vardges Levonyan\n How do elected representatives respond when they learn that they are misaligned with their constituencies? While existing research has documented various mechanisms promoting alignment between public opinion and legislative behavior, including electoral turnover, candidate self-selection, and elite influence on public opinion, less is known about how politicians handle misalignment. Previous studies suggest two primary responses: updating positions to match constituent preferences or discounting opposing views. We propose and investigate a third response: strategic issue avoidance. Using the 2016 Brexit referendum as an information treatment that creates within-issue, within-election period, within-MP variation in alignment, we study how MPs responded to sudden, measurable incongruence with their constituencies. We find that MPs who learn that they are misaligned with their districts avoid issues on which they are misaligned, relative to their aligned counterparts. When speaking about the misaligned issue, they avoid stance-taking on the issue. They also avoid mentioning their constituency. Our results show how misaligned MPs abstain from controversial issues to avoid drawing attention to topics where there is a mismatch between the legislature and the constituency. \nChilling in the Shade: Climate change resilience and climate change beliefs (2025)\nWork in progress\nThe female vote and PR adoption\n  with Mona Morgan-Collins\n Did women play a role in the adoption of proportional representation system? In this paper, we explore how women’s suffrage at the turn of the 20th century shaped politicians’ propensity to vote for the adoption of proportional electoral system (PR) in Norway. Extant literature uncovers two broad explanations for adoption of PR. One emphasizes strategic/instrumental incentives of parties and employers (e.g. Leemann and Mares 2014; Cusack et al 2010; Boix 1999; Cox et al 2018). The other emphasizes normative-based demands from voters and politicians (Blais et al 2004; Bol et al 2015). However, neither account considers the role of women. Whilst most Western countries that adopted PR at the turn of the twentieth century did so before women gained equal voting rights, this was not always the case. A notable exception is Norway (see Skorge 2023, Teele 2023), where women’s suffrage (1909, 1915 election years) was adopted before the switch to PR at the national level (and partly also local level) (1921 election year). We fill this gap by studying the role of women in the adoption of PR in Norway. Utilizing sex-separated data on turnout and roll calls of legislative support for PR, we find that politicians were more likely to support PR adoption in districts where women’s turnout was high. By showing that men’s turnout is not correlated with politicians’ propensity to support PR, we cast doubts on the possibility that these results reflect men’s preference for PR or demands for greater democratization of a highly active electorate. \nIs Anyone Watching?
